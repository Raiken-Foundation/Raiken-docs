                We're building tools to make end-to-end testing faster, more reliable, and less painful for engineering teams.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-white mb-4">The problem we're solving</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    E2E tests are essential, but they're also a constant source of friction. Writing them takes time. Maintaining them takes more. And when they break, often due to minor UI changes, teams either waste hours debugging or disable them entirely.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The result is a gap between "we should have tests" and "we actually do." QA becomes a bottleneck, coverage stays low, and regressions slip through.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                    We built Raiken to close that gap.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-white mb-4">Our approach</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Raiken is a CLI tool that generates Playwright tests from plain English descriptions. But unlike generic AI code generators, Raiken understands your project first. It indexes your codebase, captures your actual UI, and uses that context to produce tests that work.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Everything runs locally. Your code stays on your machine. The only thing sent to the AI is the minimal context needed for generation.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                    We believe testing tools should be fast to set up, easy to use, and respect your privacy by default.
